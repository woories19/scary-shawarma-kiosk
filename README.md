# Scary Shawarma Kiosk (Godot Remake & Expansion)

A learning-focused recreation and expansion of the popular Roblox game **Scary Shawarma Kiosk**, rebuilt from the ground up using the **Godot Engine**.

This project is being developed collaboratively as a hands-on way to learn game development fundamentals, engine workflows, and collaborative version control — while also experimenting with original ideas beyond the source inspiration.

---

## Project Overview

**Scary Shawarma Kiosk (Godot)** aims to:
- Recreate the core gameplay loop of the original Roblox experience
- Preserve the unsettling / eerie atmosphere that made the original memorable
- Expand the game with **new mechanics, systems, and content**
- Serve as a structured learning project for Godot and general game dev concepts

This is **not a 1:1 clone** — once the base mechanics are established, the project will evolve in its own direction.

---

## Inspiration

Inspired by the Roblox game **Scary Shawarma Kiosk**, which combines:
- Simple food-serving mechanics
- Psychological horror elements
- Minimalist environments
- Gradual tension build-up

All original assets, code, and systems in this repository are created independently for educational purposes.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Game Engine:** Godot Engine (version to be finalized)
- **Language:** GDScript (with possible future C# experimentation)
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **Target Platforms:**  
  - PC (Linux / Windows)
  - Other platforms may be explored later

---

## Learning Goals

This project is intentionally structured to help us learn:

- Godot project structure & scene system
- Player interaction systems
- AI / NPC behavior
- Basic horror design principles
- Sound design & environmental storytelling
- Game state management
- Performance considerations
- Team collaboration using Git
